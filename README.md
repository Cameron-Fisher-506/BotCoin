# BotCoin

BotCoin consumes Luno’s APIs to automatically buy and sell XRP. I have implemented different algorithms such as Fibonacci Retracement and Support/Resistance Strategy: Simple Moving Average, which uses straight line formulars to determine whether the market is in an up/down trend to smartly detect the right time to buy/sell XRP. In future BotCoin will have the ability to trade other coins as well. 

Please have a look at my code on GitHub and my Medium articles which are still in progress.
